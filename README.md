# NileFlow-ZTest-Analysis

### Overview
This project involves inferential statistical analysis on the Nile River flow data, specifically utilizing a one-sample Z-test to assess if the sample mean deviates significantly from a hypothesized population mean. The analysis provides insights into the dataset's statistical characteristics and tests the significance of observed differences.

### Dataset
- **Name**: Nile Dataset
- **Description**: Represents annual flow measurements of the Nile River in billion cubic meters, recorded over a century.
- **Source**: Commonly used in hydrology and statistical analysis for studying long-term water flow trends.

### Objective
The primary aim of this analysis is to determine whether the sample mean differs significantly from a hypothesized population mean through hypothesis testing using a one-sample Z-test.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: Loaded and explored the "Nile" dataset with summary statistics.
2. **Sampling**: Randomly selected a sample of size 50 from the dataset with replacement.
3. **Z-Test**: Calculated the Z-score and p-value to test the hypothesis.
4. **Result Interpretation**: Used p-value to determine the statistical significance and draw conclusions.

### Key Results
- **Z-score** and **p-value** calculated to evaluate the null hypothesis.
- The p-value guides the acceptance or rejection of the hypothesis, with results providing insight into the relationship between the sample and hypothesized mean.

### Conclusion
The Z-test outcomes are interpreted to determine the statistical significance of differences between the sample mean and population mean, contributing to the understanding of the Nile River flow trends over time.

### Requirements
- **Language**: R
